## Building a Simple Web Server for Static File Serving in Java

### Introduction to HTTP Requests and Web Servers

In this assignment, you will delve into the fundamentals of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and web servers by implementing a basic web server in Java. Understanding how web servers handle HTTP requests and serve static files is crucial for anyone aspiring to become a proficient web developer.

#### Learning Objectives

1. **Understanding HTTP Protocol:**
   - Learn the basics of HTTP requests and responses.
   - Grasp the significance of different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

2. **Building a Web Server in Java:**
   - Gain hands-on experience in creating a simple web server.
   - Implement functionality for handling HTTP GET requests.

3. **Serving Static Files:**
   - Learn how web servers serve static files like HTML, CSS, and images.
   - Understand the importance of MIME types in serving different file types.

### Instructions

#### Part 1: HTTP Basics

1. Research and provide a brief overview of the HTTP protocol.
2. Explain the differences between HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
3. Discuss the structure of an HTTP request and response.

#### Part 2: Implementing a Simple Web Server

1. Create a Java program that listens on a specified port (e.g., 8080).
2. Implement a basic HTTP server that can accept incoming connections.
3. Handle HTTP GET requests by sending a simple response.

#### Part 3: Serving Static Files

1. Extend your web server to handle static files (HTML, CSS, images).
2. Implement MIME type detection to serve files with the appropriate content type.
3. Test your server by requesting various static files.

### Grading Rubric

1. **HTTP Basics (10 points):**
   - Accurate explanation of the HTTP protocol.
   - Clear distinctions between different HTTP methods.
   - Well-defined structure of HTTP requests and responses.

2. **Implementing a Simple Web Server (30 points):**

   - Successful handling of incoming connections.
   - Proper implementation of HTTP GET request handling.

3. **Serving Static Files (40 points):**
   - Extension of the web server to serve static files.
   - Correct MIME type detection and response headers.
   - Successful testing with various static files.

4. **Code Quality and Documentation (20 points):**
   - Well-structured and organized code.
   - Comments explaining key sections of the code.
   - Adherence to best practices in Java programming.

### Submission Guidelines

1. Submit a zip file containing all source code files.
2. Include a README.md file explaining the functionality of your web server.
3. Provide any additional instructions necessary for running and testing your program.
