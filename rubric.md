| **Criteria**                                          | **Exemplary (90-100%)**                                     | **Proficient (80-89%)**                                       | **Developing (70-79%)**                                        | **Beginning (60-69%)**                                         | **Points**  |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Understanding of HTTP Protocol**                    | Thorough understanding of HTTP requests, responses, and methods is demonstrated. All aspects are explained with clarity and depth. | Good understanding of HTTP protocol with explanations that cover most of the important aspects. | Basic understanding of HTTP protocol with some correct explanations, though missing key details. | Minimal understanding of HTTP protocol, with significant gaps in explanation. |  15         |
| **Handling HTTP GET Requests**                        | Server correctly handles HTTP GET requests, processes headers accurately, and sends appropriate responses for all cases. | Server handles most HTTP GET requests correctly with minor issues in processing headers or responses. | Server handles some HTTP GET requests correctly, but has significant issues with processing headers or responses. | Server fails to correctly handle HTTP GET requests or process headers and responses appropriately. |  15        |
| **Serving Static Files (HTML, CSS, Images)**          | Server successfully serves all types of static files (HTML, CSS, images) without errors and uses proper content types. | Server serves most static files correctly but may have minor issues with specific file types or content types. | Server serves some static files but struggles with multiple file types or content types. | Server fails to serve static files or does so incorrectly for most file types. |  15        |
| **Adherence to HTTP/1.1 Protocol**                    | Server fully adheres to HTTP/1.1 protocol, including correct use of status codes and headers. | Server mostly adheres to HTTP/1.1 protocol with only minor deviations or omissions. | Server shows basic adherence to HTTP/1.1 protocol but with significant gaps or incorrect implementations. | Server fails to adhere to HTTP/1.1 protocol in key areas, leading to incorrect or incomplete responses. |  15        |
| **Design and Implementation of the Web Server**       | Server is well-designed with clear, efficient, and modular code that follows best practices for TCP/IP Client-Server applications. | Server is adequately designed with mostly clear code and some use of best practices, though with minor inefficiencies. | Server design is functional but has notable inefficiencies or poor modularity, with some best practices not followed. | Server design is poor, with unclear, inefficient code and little adherence to best practices. |  15        |
| **Documentation and Code Comments**                   | Code is thoroughly documented with clear comments that explain all key functions and logic. | Code is well-documented with comments that explain most functions and logic. | Code has some documentation and comments, but important sections are missing explanations. | Code is poorly documented with minimal or no comments, making it difficult to understand. |  10         |
| **Testing and Debugging**                             | Server has been thoroughly tested with a wide range of cases, and all issues have been effectively debugged. | Server has been tested with most common cases, with minor bugs remaining. | Server has been tested but significant bugs or unhandled cases remain. | Server has been minimally tested, with major bugs or unhandled cases present. |  10        |

**Total Points: 100**
